<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a feature-rich application for writing accounting-related blog articles.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   Generate articles perfectly optimized for SEO AI.
-   Provide both a visual editor and an HTML view for editing content.
-   Suggest article topics.
-   Include an AI assistant to help improve the SEO score of a generated article.
-   Add an image generator (using Nano Banana) for article content, with the ability to insert images directly into the visual editor.
-   Implement different content templates (e.g., standard article, listicle, case study).
-   Generate a series of related articles from a single topic.
-   Implement JWT authentication, multi-client workspaces, and an admin role.
-   The admin user should be able to manage user accounts (create, edit, delete).
-   The application should have a modern, professional design based on the Kurdynowski branding.

**User's preferred language**:
The user communicates in **Polish**. All responses to the user MUST be in Polish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack FARM (FastAPI, React, MongoDB) application that functions as a complete SEO Article Builder. It includes:
-   **Authentication:** A full JWT authentication system with registration, login, and protected routes.
-   **Dashboard:** Displays user-specific statistics.
-   **Article Generation:** A page to generate articles from a topic and keywords, with a choice of advanced content templates (e.g., listicles, case studies).
-   **Article Editor:** A feature-rich editor with:
    -   A rich-text (visual) and an HTML view.
    -   An **AI SEO Assistant** that provides a list of actionable suggestions and a chat interface to improve the article.
    -   An **enhanced Image Generator** with predefined styles, 4-variant generation, and a button to insert images directly into the editor.
    -   Panels for Table of Contents, FAQs, SEO analysis, etc.
-   **Article Series Generation:** A dedicated page to generate an outline for a series of articles based on a topic and optional source materials.
-   **Workspaces & Admin Role:** Data is scoped per user (). An admin role () is implemented, allowing an admin user to bypass data scoping. The UI displays an ADMIN badge for admin users.
-   **Branding:** The entire application has been redesigned with a modern, professional look based on the Kurdynowski brand identity, including a specific color palette and typography (Instrument Serif).

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Future Tasks:**
-   **P1: Deeper Article Series Generation**: The current implementation creates a series outline. A future enhancement could be to automatically generate the full content for all articles in the series.
-   **P2: Advanced Image Generator Features**: The user may request further enhancements to the image generator, such as more fine-grained control or different AI models.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **AI SEO Assistant (Phase 5)**: Implemented a new panel in the editor with AI-powered SEO suggestions and a chat interface.
-   **Application Redesign (Phase 6)**: Overhauled the entire UI with new branding (colors, typography) based on the Kurdynowski logo and design guidelines.
-   **Advanced Content Templates (Phase 7)**: Added a template selection feature to the article generator for creating specialized content like listicles and case studies.
-   **JWT Authentication (Phase 8)**: Built a complete user authentication system from scratch.
-   **Workspaces & Admin Scoping (Phase 9)**: Scoped all data to be user-specific and introduced an admin role with global data access.
-   **Image Generator v2 (Phase 10)**: Enhanced the image generator with style presets and 4-variant generation.
-   **Image Insertion in Editor (Phase 11)**: Added functionality to insert generated images directly into the visual editor.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1**: The testing agent reported a low-priority HTML structure warning on the frontend during the last test run. The agent dismissed it as non-critical, but it may indicate a minor issue in one of the components that could be investigated.
    -   **Debug checklist**: Rerun the frontend tests with  and analyze the  report to pinpoint the exact component causing the warning.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: Ensures the application follows best practices and eliminates potential silent bugs.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix**: frontend
    -   **Is recurring issue?**: N

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   Issue recurrence in previous fork: None
-   Recurrence count: 0
-   Status: NA

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Stack**: FARM (FastAPI, React, MongoDB)
-   **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication using  for token creation/validation and  for password hashing.
-   **Authorization**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implemented with an  flag on the User model and dependency injection in FastAPI to protect routes.
-   **Data Scoping**: All primary data (articles, images) is tied to a , ensuring users can only access their own content. Admin users can bypass this scoping.
-   **AI Integration**:  for , , and .
-   **UI/UX**:  component library, custom styling for branding,  for the editor.

**key DB schema**

-   ****: 

**changes in tech stack**
-   Added  and  for authentication.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main backend file, now includes auth routes, user-scoped endpoints, and admin-only routes.
-   **/app/backend/auth.py**: Contains all logic for JWT creation, verification, and password management.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/AdminUsers.js**: The new, in-progress frontend page for user management.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Contains the main application router, which will need to be updated for the new admin page.
-   **/app/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.js**: Provides user state, including the  flag, to the rest of the application.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
None. The codebase is relatively clean after the recent redesign.

**key api endpoints**
-   : User registration and login.
-   : Get current user details.
-   : (now user-scoped)
-   : (new)
-   : (new, admin-only) CRUD endpoints for user management.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Admin Credentials**: An admin account has been created:  / . Use this account to test all admin-related functionality.
-   **Data Scoping is Live**: When testing as a non-admin user, you will only see data created by that user. The dashboard will appear empty for a new user. Log in as the admin to see all data (if any exists) or to manage users.
-   **Continue Admin Feature**: Your immediate task is to complete the frontend for the Admin User Management page and connect it to the existing backend endpoints.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
-   ** (PENDING)**: The user requested the currently in-progress feature: allow the admin to create new accounts and grant permissions. This is the task you must now complete.
-   The preceding messages confirm the plan to implement workspaces, admin functionality, image generator improvements, and article series generation, all of which have been started or completed.
